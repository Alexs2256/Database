Turtleback Zoo is a graduate level computer science project in which both Java and SQL are used to implement a hypothetical database. The database is supposed to emulate that of a zoo and has all of the functionality that a real zoo's database would have. You can insert employees, animals, species, buildings, and attractions. You can also edit and view all of these as you would in a real database.
